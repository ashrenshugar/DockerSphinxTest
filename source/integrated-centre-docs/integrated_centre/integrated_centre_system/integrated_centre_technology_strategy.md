# Integrated Centre Technology Strategy

[[_TOC_]]

## Introduction

The concepts, practices and technologies described in this document are the reality of distributed software-based
systems and therefore:
- Are the future that distributed C2 systems will live within.
- Are the enablers of distributed C2 systems.

Therefore researchers within the Integrated Centre must take this reality into account and understand that **pathway
to impact** lies through all this.

An overview of the technologies and concepts below can be found in the [Integrated Centre Deep Dive](https://govteams.sharepoint.com/:p:/s/dstwcsdintcombatcloud/ET8Gad2Fpc9CvuviLBy3za8B1GTZFX78_gtlQ2E7zJW78g?e=gbBcHz)
