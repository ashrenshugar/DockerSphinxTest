# General overview of Ansible deployment process

_Disclaimer_: This is all my understanding of how deployments are structured
from looking into how some existing deployments have been structured. Some of
it is probably wrong and will need updating as things are understood better and
requirements change. Some roles and deployments have stubs or configuration
areas for services like `Consul`, `Traefik`, `Prometheus`, etc that I haven't even
started considering yet.
